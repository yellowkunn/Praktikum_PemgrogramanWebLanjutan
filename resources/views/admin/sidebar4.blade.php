            I'm still a fan even though I was salty <br>
            Hate to see you with some other broad, know you happy <br>
            Hate to see you happy if I'm not the one driving <br> <br>
            I'm so mature, I'm so mature <br>
            I'm so mature, I got me a therapist to tell me there's other men <br>
            I don't want none, I just want you <br>

            I tried to ration with you, no murders, no crimes of passion, but damn <br> <br>
            You was out of reach <br>
            You was at the farmer's market with your perfect peach <br>
            Now I'm in amazement, playing on my patience <br>
            Now you laying face-down, got me singing over a beat <br> <br>
